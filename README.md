## üìä Test Status

**Current Test Results (as of latest run):**
- ‚úÖ **37 tests passing** (77% pass rate)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **11 tests failing** (mostly AI integration and async issues)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è **25 tests skipped** (require async setup or external dependencies)

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Core functionality: **100% passing**
- ‚úÖ CLI interface: **80% passing** 
- ‚úÖ Vulnerability detection: **100% passing**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AI features: **60% passing** (some async integration issues)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Advanced features: **Skipped** (require full environment setup)

*Note: The failing tests are primarily related to async integration and AI features that require additional setup. Core security scanning functionality is fully operational.*

**To verify test status:**
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run only core functionality tests
python -m pytest tests/test_core_functionality.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=njordscan --cov-report=html
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install NjordScan
pip install njordscan

# Basic scan
njordscan scan .

# Advanced scan with AI
njordscan scan . --mode deep --ai-enhanced --behavioral-analysis
